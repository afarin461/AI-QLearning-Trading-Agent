## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview & Academic Context

This project implements a **Q-Learning based Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** to perform **algorithmic trading** on a single financial asset (AAPL). The primary goal is for the agent to learn an **optimal trading policy** to maximize cumulative profit while managing trading costs.

This was developed as an **AI course project** at K. N. Toosi University of Technology (Spring 2024).

## ðŸ’¡ Core RL Components & Implementation

The project utilizes **Tabular Q-Learning** on a carefully engineered **discretized state space**.

### The Agent's Decision Cycle

The agent operates daily, choosing one of three discrete actions:

| Action | Description | Effect on Position |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 - Short** | Opens a short position (bets on price drop). | Position = $-1$ |
| **1 - Hold** | Maintains current position (no trade). | Position = $0$ |
| **2 - Long** | Opens a long position (bets on price increase). | Position = $+1$ |

### State Space Engineering (Discretization)

Since Tabular Q-Learning requires a finite state space, three key financial indicators were **discretized** into categorical bins to define the state:

| Feature | Source File | Categories (Example Bins) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Returns** | `data_preparation.py` | Down, Flat, Up |
| **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** | `data_preparation.py` | Oversold (0-30), Neutral (30-70), Overbought (70-100) |
| **Volume** | `data_preparation.py` | Low, Medium, High (based on quantiles) |

**The Agent's State** is a tuple of these three categories, e.g., `('Up', 'Neutral', 'Medium')`.
